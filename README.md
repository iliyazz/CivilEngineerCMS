This is educational project for SoftUni's ASP.NET Advanced course, built using ASP.NET MVC, Entity framework core, C#, Microsoft SQL Server, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

The application is a Civil Engineer Customer Management System for consulting and design firms. The purpose of the application is to help with the organization of work of the company and at the same time to enable the client to monitor the work process.
There are three types of application users: employees, customers, and administrators.
Only those registered as employees can be administrators.
The application has one seed account for admin with username: iliyaz.softuni@gmail.com and initial password: 123456Admin-+.

The sequence of operation when initializing the application:
Any user can freely register in the application with email and password.
After registration, the site administrator creates an employee or customer.
The administrator creates a project. When creating the project, one of the employees is added as the project manager, and the client connects to the project to monitor the work progress.
The administrator can assign employees to the project or leave this work to the manager.

Customers can monitor the work process.

A manager, who is also an employee, is assigned to each project.
The project manager can do the following:
-adds and removes employees to the project, depending on its specifics.
-edit the data to project
-read, create and edit edit comments to the project
-reads, creates and edits data on payments made to the project

The employee involved in the project can add comments and read other comments.

The administrator can do the following:
-after user registration, the administrator enters additional data and creates a client or employee from the respective user.
-remove customers and employees from the system
-creates projects, appoints a project manager and connects the client to the project
-edit the data of all projects
-edit the data of all customers
-edit the data of all employees
-to grant administrative rights to employees

Customers can only access the projects they are joined to.
Employees can only access and work on the projects they are attached to.
Managers only have access to and can work with the projects they are managers of.
Administrators have access to and can work with all projects, employees and customers.
